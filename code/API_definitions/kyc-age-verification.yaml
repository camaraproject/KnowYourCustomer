  title: Know Your Customer Age Verification

  description: |

    # Summary
    This API provides the customer with the ability to check if the user of the line is older than a provided age, in order to provide API customer's age-restricted services, access to its age-restricted website etc..

    # API functionality

    The API defines one service endpoint:

    - `POST /verify`

      Takes the network subscription identifier (e.g. the mobile phone number for a mobile network subscriber) and checks if the age of the subscriber is older than the age threshold in the request.
      Additionally, as optional function, provides (1) if age check is done against another form of official identification or not (verifiedStatus), (2) an overall score of how certain is the response using both information provided in the request and information that the Operator holds(identityMatchScore), (3) an indicator on whether the subscription has any kind of content lock (contentLock) and (4) an indicator on whether the subscription has any kind of parental control activated (parentalControl).


    ## Inputs

    The endpoint request body is a JSON object with the following parameters:
    - `phoneNumber`: The network subscription identifier (i.e. the phone number of the subscriber). [Required only in case a 2-legged flow has been agreed between API Provider and API Consumer following CAMARA directives; otherwise, phoneNumber must not be included]
    - `ageThreshold`: The age threshold from which the age of the user must be compared. [Required]
    - any of `idDocument`, `name`, `givenName`, `familyName`, `middleNames`, `familyNameAtBirth`, `birthdate`, `email`; additional subscriber's information to be checked in order to confirm that the subscriber is the contract's owner [Optional]
    - `includeContentLock` and `includeParentalControl`: These two flags allow the API Client to indicate that the corresponding response properties `contentLock` and `parentalControl` should be returned. Its implementation is optional for the API Provider, so in such cases, these parameters will be ignored. [Optional]


    ## Outputs

    If successful, a JSON object is returned containing the following data:
    - `ageCheck`: Indicate 'true' when the age of the user is the same age or older than the age threshold (age >= age threshold), and 'false' if not (age < age threshold).  Otherwise, 'not_available'.
    - `verifiedStatus`: true if the information provided was checked against another form of official identification, otherwise false.
    - `identityMatchScore`: The overall score of identity information available in the Operator, information either provided in the request body comparing it to the one that the MNO holds or directly using internal MNO's information. It is optional for the Operator to return the Identity match score.
    - `contentLock`: Indicates if the subscription associated with the phone number has any kind of content lock (i.e certain web content blocked).
    - `parentalControl`: Indicates if the subscription associated with the phone number has any kind of parental control activated.
    
    ## Errors

    - If the authentication access token is not valid, a `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` error is returned
    - If the API call contains a formatting or other any other syntactic error, a `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
    - If the network subscription cannot be identified from the provided parameters (e.g. the subscription identifier is not associated with any customer of the CSP), a `404 IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND` error is returned.
    - If the API consumer has a valid access token but is not authorised to request an age verification for the specified network subscription, then a `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` error is returned.
    - Other errors may be returned as specified below.

    # Identifying the phone number from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a phone number as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `phoneNumber` field, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `phoneNumber` field is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `phoneNumber` field is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same phone number is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

        As it is possible that the person holding the contract and the end-user of the subscription may not be the same, the endpoint also admits a list of optional properties to be included in the request to improve the identification. The response may optionally include the `identityMatchScore` property with a value that indicates how certain it is that the information returned relates to the person that the API Client is requesting. To increase the reliability of the information returned, the API Provider may include in the response the `verifiedStatus` property, indicating whether the identity information in its possession has been verified against an identification document legally accepted as an age verification document.

        If the API Client indicates request properties `includeContentLock` or `includeParentalControl` with value `true` and the API Provider implements this functionality, then the response will also include `contentLock` and `parentalControl` properties to indicate if the subscription has any kind of content filtering enabled. On the other hand, if the request properties are not included or the API Client specifies value `false`, then the response properties will not be returned. If the API Provider doesn't implement this functionality, request properties will be ignored and response properties won't be returned in any case.
