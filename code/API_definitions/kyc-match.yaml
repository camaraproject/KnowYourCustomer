  title: Know Your Customer Match

  description: |

    This API provides the customer with the ability to compare the information it (Service Provider, SP) has for a particular mobile phone user with that on file (and verified) by the mobile phone user's Operator in their own KYC records, in order for the SP to confirm the accuracy of the information and provide a specific service to the mobile phone user.

    ## Relevant Definitions and concepts

    * **KYC**: stands for Know Your Customer and it is the process of a business verifying the identity of their clients and assessing their suitability, along with the potential risks of illegal intentions towards the business relationship.

    * **Match Score**: a numerical value that quantifies the similarity between two pieces of text based on the words they contain. This score is often used in various applications like text comparison, plagiarism detection, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The score typically reflects how well the words in one text match the words in another text. In the context of this API, this score will be used to determine how much does the input information looks like the information stored in the Operator's system. Unless otherwise captured in the implementation notes which Operators may publish, score will use the Jaro-Winkler distance algorithm for all countries. This parameter, as optional, will be returned depending on the capability of the Operator to calculate the scoring value. This means that not all Operators will implement this functionality or won't have the requested parameter available. It can happen that an Operator implements the score functionality but, for whatever reason, is not able to calculate it based on the client's input or the related stored information. For these cases, the score property related won't be returned in the response.
    The range of score values is between "0" and "100", where higher scores indicate a higher similarity between the two compared parameters.
    
    ## API Functionality

    This API allows API clients to verify the matching of a number of attributes related to a customer identity against the account data bound to their phone number.  The API is intended to be used in the following scenarios, for example:

    * To verify the user personal data during the digital registration of an account to a 3rd party service.

    * To prevent fraud, wrong or imprecise information, and/or facilitate the onboarding of a mobile phone user to a 3rd party service.

    The API supports a multi-level hierarchy of property validation. In addition to the initial verification of the `phoneNumber`, an additional `idDocument` validation may occur based on different Operator requirements. This means that, in those cases, if the value of `idDocument` is not provided or it does not match the one bound to the specific phone number in the Operator systems, the operation will return an error.

    The following figure is the generic high-level flows of this API.

    Note:

    * Before calling this API, 3rd parties / enterprise customers who want to use this API should make contact with API provider/ MNO for use of this API.  As that will depend on each API provider / MNO's business process as well as GSMA Open Gateway standard process, it is out of scope of this API definition.

    * When calling this API, at the beginning, there should be required processes for Authentication / Authorisation / End User Consent capturing.  As those processes are defined as CAMARA commonality standards, they are out of scope of this API definition, however, use of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) is stated as security scheme.

    ## Resources and Operations overview

    The API provides the following endpoint:

    * An endpoint to verify the matching of a number of attributes related to a mobile phone user identity against the account data bound to their phone number.

    # Identifying the phoneNumber from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a phoneNumber as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional phoneNumber field, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used, the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token. So, the optional phoneNumber is not used for identifying the subject, but, if it is provided in the API request body, it needs to match with the one associated with the access token.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional phoneNumber field is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code. This is an error typically, but not uniquely, returned in 2-legged scenarios when the access token doesn't identify a single subscription.
    - If there is a mismatch between the provided phone number in the request body and the phone number associated with the access token, the server will return an error with the `403 INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT` error code.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

      description: |-
        Verify matching of a number of attributes related to a customer identity against the verified data bound to their phone number in the Operator systems. Regardless of whether the `phoneNumber` is explicitly stated in the request body, at least one of the other fields must be provided, otherwise a `HTTP 400 - KNOW_YOUR_CUSTOMER.INVALID_PARAM_COMBINATION` error will be returned.

        In order to proceed with the match check, some Operators may have the requirement to perform an additional level of validation based on the `idDocument` property. This means that, in those cases, the `idDocument` is required and the provided value needs to match the one stored in the Operator system associated with the indicated `phoneNumber`. This validation will be done before proceeding with the match check of the rest of the properties. The following two rules apply only in the cases where the Operator have the requirement to validate the `idDocument`:
        - If no `idDocument` is provided, then a `HTTP 403 - KNOW_YOUR_CUSTOMER.ID_DOCUMENT_REQUIRED` error will be returned.
        - If the provided `idDocument` does not match the one stored in the Operator systems, then a `HTTP 403 - KNOW_YOUR_CUSTOMER.ID_DOCUMENT_MISMATCH` error will be returned.

        The API will return the result of the matching process for each requested attribute. This means that the response will **only** contain the attributes for which validation has been requested. Possible values are:
          - **true**: the attribute provided matches with the one in the Operator systems.
          - **false**: the attribute provided does not match with the one in the Operator systems.
          - **not_available**: the attribute is not available to validate.
